              Whoever adopts teaching as a profession assumes the obligation to conduct Â· himself / herself in accordance with the ideal of the profession. A teacher is constantly under the scrutiny of her/his students and the society at large. Therefore, every teacher should see that there is no incompatibility between her/his precepts and practice. The national ideals of education which have already been set forth and which she/he should seek to inculcate among students must be her/his own ideals. The profession further requires that the teacher should be calm, patient and communicative by temperament and amiable in disposition.
