                Extracurricular activities are activities that fall outside the
                scope of our regular curriculum. It requires a regular time
                commitment and dedication. Daulat Ram College has always
                believed in giving great emphasis to Extracurricular activities,
                considering it an integral part of the overall development of
                the students, be it intellectual, physical, moral, sensible and
                social development. This committee has dedicated faculty members
                of our Institution to encourage students for culminating their
                skills in wide arena other than academics.
