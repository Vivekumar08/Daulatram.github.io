                25th November, 2020. It was organised by the Department of
                Biochemistry, Daulat Ram College. Covid 19 pandemic has impacted
                the whole world and the key to prevent the spread is early
                detection. We were very fortunate to have with us Dr Debojyoti
                Chakraborty and his team who have been pioneers in indigenously
                developing CRISPR based COVID-19 detection kit which is now
                popularly known as Feluda.
