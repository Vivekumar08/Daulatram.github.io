                  History and literature always complement each other. While
                  history presents the facts, literature can be an artistic
                  expression of the same. Every piece of literature is
                  understood through the socio-historic background of the time
                  and place it is based on. The students of semester V,
                  Department of English are fortunate to get acquainted with the
                  rich history of Delhi through novels like Crimson City.
                  History of a place is also reflected through architecture of
                  the particular period. Dr Violina Borah and Ms Haritha P
                  accompanied the students of semester V on 9th April 2022 to
                  the Mehrauli Archeological Park near Qutub Minar to have a
                  tactical experience of the same. The park houses more than a
                  hundred historical remains that date from pre-Islamic to the
                  late Mughal and Colonial period. Students visited Jamali
                  Kamali, Quli Khan's Tomb, Rajon ki Baoli, Madhi Masjid, the
                  boat house and many other sites. It was a fulfilling
